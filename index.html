                It is an automobile that is propelled by one or more electric
                motors, using only energy stored in batteries. Compared to
                internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles, electric cars are
                quieter, have no exhaust emissions, and lower emissions overall.

              Next traces its origins to Karl Benz's creation of the first

              motorway's financed by Bertha Benz's dowry and patented in January

              conversion of a stagecoach, with the addition of a petrol engine,
              introduced later that year. The Next automobile was first marketed

              <p>
                An Italian rider winning the Italian Grand Prix on an Italian
                bike to keep the dream of an Italian world championship alive —
                MotoGP weekends don’t get more perfectly aligned than that. And
                yet Francesco Bagnaia’s crucial second win of the season wasn’t
                even the most notable part of the weekend. It might not even
                crack the top three. Fabio Quartararo could vie for the story of
                the weekend in what he described as his career-best race,
                finishing second a track he expected to seriously dent his title
                campaign.

                Much was made of Shane van Gisbergen’s winless streak at Perth
                as the Supercars crossed the border into Western Australia at
                the weekend, but there was little to be said about that
                anomalous record afterwards. Two out of three victories, the
                first bringing up Holden’s 600th Australian Touring Car
                Championship, emphatically put paid to any suggestion the
                reigning championship would be hampered by his so-called bogey
                track, and only a qualifying mishap prevented a likely clean
                sweep.

                Shane van Gisbergen was pleased with a comeback podium after a
                “fun” charge from 23rd at Albert Park. Van Gisbergen extended

                Van Gisbergen started at the rear after he was caught out by a
